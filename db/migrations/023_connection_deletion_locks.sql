-- delete_connection_data and delete_workspace_data checked for sending rows in a way that raced with the reply worker:
-- delete_connection_data did not lock the rows, so an uncommitted claim read as pending and the deletes then removed
-- the row after the claim committed it as sending, and a row inserted after the check was never seen. It now locks
-- the connection FOR UPDATE, which also conflicts with the key-share locks of inserts referencing it.
-- Both functions now lock the delivery rows with NOWAIT and refuse with sending_in_progress when another transaction
-- holds one: waiting would deadlock with a send being finalized, which holds its outbox row and then needs a
-- key-share lock on the connection. The bodies are otherwise unchanged from migration 021.
